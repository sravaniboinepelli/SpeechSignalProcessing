### Feature Extraction:

Run *codes/feature_extraction/sgroup_delay.m* for extracting modified group delay features.  

Run *codes/feature_extraction/inst_features.m* for extracting instaneous amplitude/frequency features.  

Run *codes/model/labelling.py* to arrange features for each language file and label them accordingly.

Run *codes/model/language_detection.ipynb* for viewing the results on a simple SVM model
